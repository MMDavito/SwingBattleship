To start: Read "Start.MD".

The game GUI is pretty straight forward.
However, some notes:
1. If you play against AI you will need to hover over the AI gameboard to redraw it.
2. If you want to know the current round number you need to look in the console.
3. If you want to know how the oposite player placed his/her ships you must close the highscore list.
4. To restart, press close/exit on the gameing board.

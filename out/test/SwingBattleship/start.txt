Requirements:
This is only tested on Java JDK 11.0.8.

The reference implementations are available for download from here:

Linux/windows start Instruction:
1. Start terminal/console.
2. Navigate to the directory of jar "SwingBattleship.jar" inside of
the directory: "/out/artifacts/SwingBattleship_jar"
